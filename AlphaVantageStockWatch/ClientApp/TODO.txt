1. Create loop to get current data and display in as tape
    see if you can grab multiple symbols with one call
        the logic behind this one should be to catch up on most recent numbers since other calls.

    have a dropdown for symbols to add the the tape
        get list from api site or scrape
        try using this for autocomplete
