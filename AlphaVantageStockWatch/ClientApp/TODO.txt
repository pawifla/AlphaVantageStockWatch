TODO FOR STOCK WATCH:

1. Create loop to get current data and display in as tape
    see if you can grab multiple symbols with one call
        the logic behind this one should be to catch up on most recent numbers since other calls.
        it will wait if there are other calls wanted but will continue to update if not.
    have a dropdown for symbols to add the the tape
        get list from api site or scrape
        try using this for autocomplete

Create a json/grapher
    get the timeseriesData and shuv the json into a grapher
    see how you can compare on the same grid.

Create a company page where you can look at the company overview
    function=OVERVIEW

Integrate Cryptos
    either same functions as the rest, or separate place

UP NEXT:
    well, that was way harder than anticipated. 
    next steps do easy things.
        +use yahoo query to get current price for TickerTape 
            data needed: Symbol, current Price, Percentage change on the day.
            use the mf yahoo deal. way easier
        + another easy thing to do will be to use the yahoo autocomplete deal for a search option for tickers
            generate a drop down list based on the api 
                data needed: symbol, company name
        +once these are complete, begin making an overview page that uses alphavantage.
            this will use the overview function paired with the autocomplete thingy
            this will be the most long one to deal with
        +finally, find a graphing library to shove the alphavantage data into.
            figure out how to change based on times, and such.
